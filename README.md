# File Search Recursive System

This project is a **File Search Recursive System** built in C++. It allows users to recursively search for files within a directory based on specified search criteria.

## Files

### 1. `FileSearchRecursive.cpp`
This C++ source file contains the implementation of the recursive file search. The program performs the following tasks:
- Scans directories and subdirectories.
- Finds files based on user-defined criteria (e.g., file name or extension).
- Displays the matching file paths.

## How to Compile

To compile the project, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
g++ -o file_search FileSearchRecursive.cpp
```

This will create an executable file named `file_search`.

## How to Run

After compiling, run the program with the following command:

```bash
./file_search [directory_path] [search_pattern]
```

- `directory_path`: The path of the directory to search in.
- `search_pattern`: The pattern to search for (e.g., `*.txt` to find all text files).

### Example:

```bash
./file_search /home/user/Documents *.cpp
```

This command will recursively search for all `.cpp` files in the `Documents` directory.

## Dependencies

- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).
- A file system with directories and files to search through.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements include:
- Adding support for more advanced search filters (e.g., file size, date modified).
- Improving error handling for invalid directories or inaccessible files.
- Providing an option for case-insensitive searches.
